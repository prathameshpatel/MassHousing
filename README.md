The Weka API for Java is quite extensive in its
features for data filtering, attribute selection
and algorithm implementation. For the
purpose of our project we needed to choose
a particular algorithm that would be most
useful and predictively accurate considering
the data provided. Developments are rated
A, B, C, D, and F. Any development with an A
risk rating is low risk, meaning the
development is financially secure and not at
risk of meeting its financial obligations. A
development with an F risk rating is
considered high risk. B, C, and D
developments are somewhere in between.
The method of implementation is divided
into 3 phases.
